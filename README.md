# Linear Regression Example

This is a simple example demonstrating linear regression using synthetic data. The code generates synthetic data, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance.

## Getting Started

To run this example locally or in a Jupyter notebook, make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```
## Code Structure
linear_regression_example.py: Python script containing the linear regression code.

## Output
After running the script, you will see a scatter plot of the actual data points and the linear regression line. Evaluation metrics (Mean Squared Error and R-squared) will be printed to the console.

## Inference
The generated synthetic data follows a linear relationship, and the linear regression model captures this pattern effectively. The evaluation metrics provide insights into the model's performance.
